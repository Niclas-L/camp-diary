# camp-diary

*A web-based diary platform.*

*Inspired by a correspondence-like diary system used in some congregations in their confirmation camps where a camp participant each day answers relevant questions that an assigned counselor then reads and responds to, asking follow-up questions if needed.*

### Implemented Features ###

- Users can create accounts and login using a username and password. Users can also log out.
- Participants can see their answered and unanswered questions on a personal "My Diary"-page.
- Participants can answer unanswered questions from visible days.
- Participants can see their counselor's responses to previous questions.
- Councelors can see a list of their assigned participants and navigate to individual participants' diaries.
- Councelors can post replies to participants' answers.
- Admins can see a list of all users and delete users.
- Admins can see a list of all questions and add or delete questions.
- Admins can assign camp participants to camp leaders.
- Admins can toggle a day's questions visibility to participants.

### Possible future additions to the site
- Currently the length of the camp cannot be changed and the site only serves one camp, it is set to 8 days, in the future one could implement functionality for admins to create new camp instances and edit their length as well as assign users to correct camps.
- In the future it would be good to allow participants and counselors to continuously reply to each other's answers. For now the counselor can only reply once to a participant's answer.
