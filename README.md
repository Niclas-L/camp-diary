# camp-diary

*A web-based diary platform.*

*Inspired by a correspondence-like diary system used in some congregations in their confirmation camps where a camp participant each day answers relevant questions that an assigned counselor then reads and responds to, asking follow-up questions if needed.*

### Implemented Features ###

- Users can create accounts and login using a username and password. Users can also log out.
- Participants can see their answered and unanswered questions on a personal "My Diary"-page (users cannot yet actually answer questions).
- Admins can see a list of all users and delete users.
- Admins can see a list of all questions and add or delete questions.
- Admins can assign camp participants to camp leaders.
- Admins can toggle a day's questions visibility to participants.


### Upcoming Features ###

- Participants can navigate to the current day's diary questions and submit their answers.
- Participants can navigate to past days' questions, read their responses and answer follow-up questions.
- Counselors can see a list of camp participants that they correspond with and open their diary.
- Counselors can, after selecting a participant, select a day to respond to.
